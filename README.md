my wabbajack modlist and passion project to make skyrim as soulslike as physically possible... with my lack of game design experience and vague understanding of what 'soulslike' means.

"wabbajack" does not refer to the in game staff, but instead to an application that automatically downloads modlists for various games, so long as you have nexus premium, if you don't then it is not automatic and you will have to press "download" for all mods queued for download.

this modlist was mostly designed for my laptop so, you'll need these specs at least (i think)

CPU: 11th gen intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11800H

16 gb ram

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU

about 130-140 gigs of free space

the most recent nvidia game driver (if using an nvidia gpu)

1920x1080 resolution for skyrim in your settings for the game if not already at that resolution. i'm not sure about how wider screens will work.

requirements: 

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170 <- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable

and i think thats it but i'm not sure.

steam://controllerconfig/489830/3492537672 <- this is my steam controller configuration for this modlist, you're gonna want it.

-INSTALLATION-

Make sure to clear out your skyrim install, the easiest way to do this is by deleting the entire skyrim special edition folder, pressing "uninstall" in steam, and then reinstall the game.
you probably dont need to do this if you've never modded before, but try it just in case.

you are going to need nexus premium, and i think nothing else. you don't technically need it, but you'll have to manually download all the mods and thats going to get tiresome.

-IMPORTANT MODS- 

this modlist is made primarily for controller players, specifically xbox series x controllers. i havent the slightest clue how to play on keyboard, but you are allowed to provide such things for yourself, upload it to nexus or contribute it to me to add to the modlist by default under the "controlmap" separator. do not expect to have keyboard/mouse support by default. 

Abandoned Bonfires!

in this modlist you can ONLY save by sleeping, at bonfires or in beds, doesn't really matter, but bonfires are more readily available. 
each time you rest, you get 3 health and magicka potions, these will upgrade when you get more dragon souls, not in amount, but in quality. you can still collect potions to use.
you are ONLY able to level up after sleeping.
if you change these settings in mcm or in.... settings, i don't actually care really, but you'll lose the intended experience. if thats not important to you, do whatever you want.

-SUPPORT-
adding or removing any mods is a no no if you want help, any bugs, crashes, visual issues, anything, must be from the base modlist with nothing added or removed, or else i can't help. its not my modlist at that point.

if you have any issues, feel free to check out my subreddit and use the appropriate flairs! make sure to read the rules beforehand.
