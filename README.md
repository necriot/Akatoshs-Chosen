my wabbajack modlist and passion project to make skyrim as soulslike as physically possible... with my lack of game design experience and vague understanding of what 'soulslike' means.

"wabbajack" does not refer to the in game staff, but instead to an application that automatically downloads modlists for various games, so long as you have nexus premium, if you don't then it is not automatic and you will have to press "download" for all mods queued for download.

this modlist was mostly designed for my laptop so, you'll need these specs at least (i think)

CPU: 11th gen intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11800H

16 gb ram

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU

about 130-140 gigs of free space

the most recent nvidia game driver (if using an nvidia gpu)

1920x1080 resolution for skyrim in your settings for the game if not already at that resolution. i'm not sure about how wider screens will work.

requirements: 

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170 <- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable

and i think thats it but i'm not sure.

steam://controllerconfig/489830/3492537672 <- this is my steam controller configuration for this modlist, you're gonna want it.
